## Introduction
Welcome to my project for The Odin Project's web development course! This project involves creating a complete web page from a provided design. The challenge includes using HTML and CSS skills to match the design as closely as possible, while also incorporating personal creativity.

### Design Overview
The project design is based on two images:
1. An image of the complete website layout.

The primary font used in the design is Roboto.

## Project Objectives
- To closely replicate a provided web design.
- To implement HTML and CSS skills, such as flexbox layout.

- Start with HTML structure followed by CSS styling.
- Refer back to The Odin Project lessons and resources as needed.
